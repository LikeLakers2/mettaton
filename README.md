# mettaton
A serious bot for once. This is the code that runs Mettaton on /r/Undertale's Discord server. Revel in my shitty coding.

I will not provide support if you decide to run your own copy of this bot. With that in mind, I will also not provide support for third-party-run copies of this bot, and cannot guarantee that they will be free of malicious code.

If you wish to verify whether a copy of this bot is the one I, LikeLakers2/MichiRecRoom, run, here is the Username, discriminator, and user ID for me and my bot:
* The bot: **Mettaton#6421** (260783424908951553) (Will be marked with a bot tag)
* The coder: **MichiRecRoom#9507** (98296942768967680)

## Suggesting features or fixes
Feel free to [create an issue](https://github.com/LikeLakers2/mettaton/issues/new) to suggest new features or fixes! PRs are also allowed, though there is no guarantee I will merge them.
