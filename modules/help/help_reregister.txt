```rp!reregister```
**Usage**:
rp!reregister `<Character ID to resubmit>`

**Parameters**:
The character ID to load data from.

**Description**:
This command allows you to edit and resubmit a character that you've submitted before. It's mostly useful when your character has been denied and you wish to resubmit it instead of editing it's character data, as this sets the `Status` back to `Pending`.

**Note**:
Internally, `rp!reregister` is actually an alias for `rp!register`, so you can specify a character ID to the `rp!register` command and it will work the same as here.
