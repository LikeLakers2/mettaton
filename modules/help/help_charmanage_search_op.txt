```rp!help charmanage search op```
**The search operators (case-insensitive)**:
`EQ`, `EQUALS`, `=`, `==` all correspond to EQUALS.
`CO`, `CONTAINS`, `~`, `=~` all correspond to CONTAINS.
`REG`, `REGEX` all correspond to REGEX.
`!` followed by one of the above means NOT, or to return those which would *not* be shown by those above.

**Examples**:
`rp!cm search Name EQ Robert` would return any characters whose name is "Robert".
`rp!cm search Name CO "Mr. Left"` would return any characters whose name contains "Mr. Left".

**Regex**:
You can search using regex. This is useful primarily for administration purposes, but also if you have a complex search you want to perform all at once. Please note that you are not required to include the `/` before or after the regex. In fact, the bot strips these off before doing a search, defaulting to case-insensitivity only.
`rp!cm search Name REG ".*e.*"` shows any characters with an "e" in their name,
