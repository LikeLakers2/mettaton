Hello, I'm **Mettaton**, an RP bot built for the needs of the Official /r/Undertale Discord Roleplay. (That's a mouthful, ain't it?) I'm here to help automate some processes. Most importantly, I keep an automated log of the roleplay channels, so we don't lose *everything* should the channels be suddenly deleted again.

Any time you see `< >` around a parameter, that means it's required. You **MUST** specify these parameters.
Any time you see `[ ]` around a parameter, that means it's optional. You are **not** required to specify these parameters.
Do not include `< >` or `[ ]` around your parameters when executing commands.

To force a parameter to have spaces, put `"quotes"` around your parameter. For example, `rp!set <ID> Name "Mr. Bags"` will force "Mr. Bags" to be one parameter rather than two.

My normal invoker is `rp!`, however you may also use these in place of that: `mtt!`, `mettaton!`, `:mttyeah:`, `:mttoh:`

Here is a list of my commands. I will only show those which you have access to.

```
PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS HELP MAY BE OUTDATED IN SOME PARTS AND COMMANDS MAY NOT FUNCTION EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED.

If there is any discrepency and the bot is not helping, please feel free to ping **MichiRecRoom#9507**.

This help text will eventually be transferred over to external service (Dropbox or Github Wiki pages), but for now please understand.
