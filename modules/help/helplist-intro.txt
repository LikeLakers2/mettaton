Hello, I'm **Mettaton**, an RP bot built for the needs of the Official /r/Undertale Discord Roleplay. (That's a mouthful, ain't it?) I'm here to help automate some processes. Most importantly, I keep an automated log of the roleplay channels, so we don't lose *everything* should the channels be suddenly deleted again.

Any time you see `< >` around a parameter, that means it's required. You **MUST** specify these parameters.
Any time you see `[ ]` around a parameter, that means it's optional. You are **not** required to specify these parameters.
Do not include `< >` or `[ ]` around your parameters when executing commands.

To force a parameter to have spaces, put `"quotes"` around your parameter. For example, `rp!set <ID> Name "Mr. Bags"` will force "Mr. Bags" to be one parameter rather than two.

My normal invoker is `rp!`, however you may also use these in place of that: `mtt!`, `mettaton!`, `:mttyeah:`, `:mttoh:`

Here is a list of my commands. I will only show those which you have access to.
